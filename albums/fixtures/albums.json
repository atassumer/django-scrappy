Their better halves, Agnetha Faltskog and Frida Lyngstad, provide the blankly ingenuous vocals that allow them to pull off head-scratching lyrics such as \"Love Isn't Easy (But It Sure Is Hard Enough)\" and assessments such as Lyngstad's: \"Since our divorces, we are more mature, and our style progresses more quickly.\""
